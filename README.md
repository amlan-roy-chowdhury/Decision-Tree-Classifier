# Decision-Tree-Classifier

Creates a decision tree classifier model to train on a given dataset. Includes methods for training the tree, making predictions, splitting criteria and to determine the accuracy of the trained model on the training set.

DecisionTreeClassifier Class:

The code defines a DecisionTreeClassifier class to encapsulate the decision tree model.
The constructor (__init__) takes parameters such as max_depth (maximum depth of the tree) and min_samples_split (minimum samples required to split a node).


fit Method:

The fit method is responsible for training the decision tree. It calls a private method buildtree to construct the tree recursively.


buildtree Method:

buildtree is a recursive method that constructs the decision tree.
It checks stopping conditions, such as reaching the maximum depth, having only one class in the node, or having a small number of samples.
If the stopping conditions are met, it creates a leaf node with the most frequent class.
Otherwise, it finds the best feature and threshold to split the data and recursively builds the left and right subtrees.


findbest_split Method:

This method is a placeholder for the actual splitting logic.
It is expected to implement the criteria for finding the best split, such as Gini impurity or information gain.
You need to customize this method based on your specific splitting criterion.


predict Method:

The predict method takes a set of samples and predicts the class for each sample using the trained decision tree.
It calls a private method predictsample for each sample.


predictsample Method:

predictsample is a recursive method that traverses the decision tree to predict the class for a given sample.


Load Dataset and Instantiate Classifier:

The code uses pandas to load a CSV file (wines.csv) representing a dataset with features and labels.
It separates features (X) and labels (y).
An instance of the DecisionTreeClassifier is created with specified hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth and min_samples_split).


Train and Evaluate Classifier:

The classifier is trained on the dataset using the fit method.
The accuracy of the trained model on the training set is then computed and printed.
